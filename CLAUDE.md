# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies (also installs qpdf system dep via CI: sudo apt-get install -y qpdf)

npm run fetch        # Fetch contract note PDFs from Gmail via IMAP → saves to data/
npm run parse        # Parse decrypted PDFs in data/ → writes daily_summary.json
npm run sheet        # Update Google Sheet from daily_summary.json
npm run check-dates  # Detect date gaps in the sheet → writes gap_dates.txt

npm start            # Run the full pipeline: fetch → check-dates → parse → sheet
```

To process a specific date instead of yesterday:
```bash
TARGET_DATE=2025-04-30 npm run fetch
TARGET_DATE=2025-04-30 npm run parse
TARGET_DATE=2025-04-30 npm run sheet
```

## Architecture

This is a Node.js automation pipeline that processes daily equity/FNO contract notes from multiple brokers (currently **Finvasia / Shoonya** and **Angel One**) and records P&L summaries into a Google Sheet. It runs on a daily GitHub Actions schedule.

### Pipeline Flow

```
Gmail (IMAP) → fetchMail.js → data/*.pdf (encrypted)
                             ↓ qpdf decrypt
                           data/*_decrypted.pdf
                             ↓
                          parser.js → daily_summary.json
                             ↓
                        updateSheet.js → Google Sheet row
```

**`brokers/`** — Per-broker plugins. Each plugin exports `subject(accountId, date)` (the IMAP `SUBJECT` search string for that broker's contract-note emails) and `extract(text)` (returns `{ payin_payout_obligation, net_brokerage, other_charges }` from decrypted PDF text; `total_charges` and `final_net` are derived later by `updateSheet.js`). `brokers/index.js` is the registry plus the `BROKER_ACCOUNTS_JSON` config loader and the filename helpers (`makeFileName` / `parseFileName`).

**`fetchMail.js`** — Loads `BROKER_ACCOUNTS_JSON`, opens **one IMAP connection per email**, then iterates the broker accounts inside that mailbox. For each account it runs the broker-specific subject search, saves attachments as `<safeEmail>__<broker>__<accountId>__<originalName>.pdf`, and decrypts via the system `qpdf` binary using `pdfPassword` from the same account entry.

**`parser.js`** — Reads all `*_decrypted.pdf` files from `data/`, parses the embedded `<broker>` and `<accountId>` from the filename, dispatches to the broker plugin's `extract`, and writes `daily_summary.json` with per-account and total values.

**`checkDates.js`** — Reads `row_tracker.json` for the last-updated sheet row, fetches the date in column C of that row from the Google Sheet, and writes `gap_dates.txt` listing all missing trading dates plus tomorrow. The CI workflow loops over this file to backfill gaps. Broker-agnostic.

**`updateSheet.js`** — Reads `daily_summary.json`, resolves the next empty row via `row_tracker.json` (falling back to the sheet itself), inserts a new row, copies all formulas from the previous row via `PASTE_FORMULA`, then overwrites columns A–C (serial / day / date) and a 5-column block per account at the `sheetStartColumn` declared in `BROKER_ACCOUNTS_JSON`. The 5 columns are: `payin_payout_obligation`, `net_brokerage`, `other_charges`, `total_charges` (= brokerage + other_charges), `final_net`.

**`row_tracker.json`** — Persisted between CI runs as a GitHub Actions artifact named `row-tracker`. It stores `{ "lastUpdatedRow": N }` to avoid a live sheet read on every run.

### Config: `BROKER_ACCOUNTS_JSON`

A single env var holds a JSON array of mailboxes. Each mailbox has one Gmail login and one or more broker accounts attached to it (1 email → N accounts → 1 broker per account):

```json
[
  {
    "email": "user1@gmail.com",
    "emailPassword": "gmail-app-password-1",
    "accounts": [
      { "broker": "finvasia", "accountId": "FA1234", "pdfPassword": "pdf-pwd-1", "sheetStartColumn": "D" },
      { "broker": "angelone",  "accountId": "R59799620", "pdfPassword": "pdf-pwd-2", "sheetStartColumn": "I" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "email": "user2@gmail.com",
    "emailPassword": "gmail-app-password-2",
    "accounts": [
      { "broker": "finvasia", "accountId": "FA9999", "pdfPassword": "pdf-pwd-3", "sheetStartColumn": "N" }
    ]
  }
]
```

`sheetStartColumn` is the leftmost Google Sheet column for that account's daily values. Each account writes a contiguous 5-column block at that position:

| Offset | Column (e.g. start = `D`) | Value |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `D` | `payin_payout_obligation` |
| 1 | `E` | `net_brokerage` |
| 2 | `F` | `other_charges` |
| 3 | `G` | `total_charges` (= `net_brokerage + other_charges`, computed by `updateSheet.js`) |
| 4 | `H` | `final_net` (= `payin_payout_obligation - total_charges`, computed by `updateSheet.js`) |

Columns A–C are reserved for serial number / day name / formatted date. Pick `sheetStartColumn` for each account so the per-account 5-column blocks don't overlap; gaps between blocks (and any cells with formulas) are preserved from the previous row via `PASTE_FORMULA`.

### Adding a New Broker

1. Create `brokers/<name>.js` exporting `subject(accountId, date)` and `extract(text)`. Use `finvasia.js` and `angelone.js` as templates.
2. Register it in `brokers/index.js` by adding it to the `BROKERS` map.
3. Reference it in `BROKER_ACCOUNTS_JSON` with `"broker": "<name>"`.

The rest of the pipeline (`fetchMail.js`, `parser.js`, `updateSheet.js`, `checkDates.js`, `row_tracker.json`) needs no changes.

### Components

`components/PaginatedPreview.tsx` is a standalone React component (Next.js `"use client"`) that renders HTML content paginated via `window.Paged.Previewer` (Paged.js). It is not wired into the Node.js pipeline — it appears to be a UI component for a separate front-end that previews paginated documents. It uses stable DOM refs to avoid re-mounts, debounces re-renders, and guards against concurrent pagination runs.

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `BROKER_ACCOUNTS_JSON` | JSON array of mailboxes, each with `email`, `emailPassword`, and `accounts[]` (each account has `broker`, `accountId`, `pdfPassword`). See **Config** section above. |
| `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` | Base64-encoded Google service account JSON |
| `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` | Google Sheet ID from URL |
| `SHEET_GID` | Numeric GID of the target tab |
| `SHEET_NAME` | Name of the target tab |

`TARGET_DATE` (optional) overrides the default of yesterday (`YYYY-MM-DD` format).

### CI Workflows

`.github/workflows/` contains two workflows:
- **Daily Trading Data Processing** — runs at 00:01 UTC daily; downloads the `row-tracker` artifact, calls `check-dates`, loops over `gap_dates.txt` processing each missing date, uploads the updated artifact.
- **Update Last Updated Row** — manual `workflow_dispatch` to correct `lastUpdatedRow` in the artifact when the sheet is manually edited.
